# Rabia

## Introduction

We introduce Rabia, a simple and high performance framework for implementing state-machine replication (SMR) within a datacenter. The main innovation of Rabia is in using _randomization_ to simplify the design. Rabia provides the following two features: (i) It does not need any fail-over protocol and supports trivial auxiliary protocols like log compaction, snapshotting, and reconfiguration, components that are often considered the most challenging when developing SMR systems; and (ii) It provides high performance, up to 1.5x higher throughput than the closest competitor (i.e., EPaxos) in a favorable setup (same availability zone with three replicas) and is comparable with a larger number of replicas or when deployed in multiple availability zones.

Our SOSP paper, "[Rabia: Simplifying State-Machine Replication Through Randomization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483582)," describes Rabia's design and evaluations in detail ([SOSP Artifact Review Summary](https://sysartifacts.github.io/sosp2021/summaries/rabia.html)) and earns three badges: artifact available, artifact evaluated, and artifact reproduced. 

#### Project Keywords: 
- state-machine replication (SMR), consensus, and formal verification

#### CCS Concepts: 
- Computer systems organization → Dependable and fault-tolerant systems and networks; 
- Computing methodologies → Distributed algorithms.

## Repository structure
- deployment, internal, roles, and `main.go`: Rabia's implementation in Go and the project's auxiliary code
- proofs: proof scripts for the core weak Multivalued consensus part of the Rabia protocol.
- redis-raft: redis-raft related code and instructions
- epaxos: compiled binaries of Paxos and EPaxos for cloudlab machines from various branches in [(E)Paxos](https://github.com/zhouaea/epaxos) and 
  [(E)Paxos-NP](https://github.com/zhouaea/epaxos-single) codebases + scripts to run them
