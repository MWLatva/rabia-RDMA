# Rabia

## Introduction

Rabia is a simple and high performance framework for implementing state-machine replication (SMR) within a datacenter. 
The main innovation of Rabia is in using randomization to simplify the design. Rabia provides the following two features: 
(i) It does not need any fail-over protocol and supports trivial auxiliary protocols like log compaction, snapshotting, 
and reconfiguration, these components often considered the most challenging when developing SMR systems; and (ii) It
provides high performance, up to 1.5x higher throughput than the closest competitor (i.e., EPaxos) in an ideal setup 
(same availability zone with 3 replicas) and comparable with a larger ùëõ or when deployed in multiple zones. 

Our SOSP paper, "Rabia: Simplifying State-Machine Replication
Through Randomization," describes Rabia's design and evaluations in detail.

#### Project Keywords: state-machine replication (SMR), consensus, formal verification
